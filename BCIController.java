/*
In this example, BCIController is a class that uses a ScheduledExecutorService to continuously read commands from a BCI object and apply them to a Game object. The start() method begins this loop, and the stop() method ends it. Error handling is included to ensure that any exceptions thrown during the update process are caught and logged.
