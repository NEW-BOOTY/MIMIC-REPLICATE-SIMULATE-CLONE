//  The SingletonScriptRunner class uses the Singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of the class can be created.
The runScript method is used to execute a script provided via the command line argument.
The main method checks for the script path argument and uses the Singleton instance to run the script.
To use this program, compile it and run it from the command line, passing the path to the script you want to execute as an argument:
java SingletonScriptRunner path/to/your/script.sh

Replace path/to/your/script.sh with the actual path to the script. This setup ensures that the script running functionality is encapsulated within a Singleton instance, providing a controlled environment for script execution.
